Connect your self-hosted Nextcloud instance to Hermes Agent. Manage files, notes, calendar events, tasks, and contacts directly from any conversation. No plugins, no external services, just your data.

## What is this?

hermes-nextcloud is a skill for Hermes Agent that wraps the Nextcloud WebDAV, Notes API, CalDAV, and CardDAV protocols into a command-line interface. If you run Nextcloud on your own VPS or home server, you can read and write your data without opening a browser.

The skill communicates over HTTPS only. No desktop client or third-party sync service is required.

## Features

**Files:** Upload, download, list, delete, and move files through Nextcloud WebDAV.

**Notes:** Create, list, edit, and delete notes using the Nextcloud Notes API (requires the Notes app on your Nextcloud instance).

**Calendar:** List calendars, create and edit events via CalDAV. Times are handled in your configured timezone.

**Tasks:** Manage Nextcloud Tasks calendar items (tasks stored in a Tasks calendar).

**Contacts:** Browse and search your address books, view contact cards, export as vCard.

**Setup:** Guided setup walks you through configuring your URL, username, and app password. Nothing is stored in plain text.

## Requirements

- A running Nextcloud instance (any recent version)
- An **App Password** created in Nextcloud Settings → Security → App passwords
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Hermes Agent

## Installation

If Hermes Agent is running on the same machine where this repo is cloned:

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/skills/productivity
git clone https://github.com/adnw-vinc/hermes-nextcloud.git nextcloud
```

Alternatively, copy the `nextcloud/` directory into your skills folder manually.

## Setup

Run the guided setup:

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/productivity/nextcloud/scripts/setup.py
```

The script will ask for:
1. Your Nextcloud URL (e.g. `https://nc.example.com`)
2. Your Nextcloud username
3. An App Password (not your login password)

It validates the credentials and saves them to `~/.hermes/nextcloud.env`.

### Manual configuration

```bash
export NEXTCLOUD_URL="https://your-nextcloud.example.com"
export NEXTCLOUD_USER="your_username"
export NEXTCLOUD_TOKEN="your_app_password"
export NEXTCLOUD_TIMEZONE="Europe/Prague"   # optional, defaults to UTC
```

### Creating an App Password

1. Log in to your Nextcloud instance
2. Go to **Settings → Security → App passwords**
3. Click **Add new app password**
4. Give it a name (e.g. `hermes-agent`) and click **Create**
5. Copy the password. It is shown only once.

## Usage

All commands are called through the Python script:

```bash
NC="python3 ~/.hermes/skills/productivity/nextcloud/scripts/nextcloud_api.py"
```

### Files

```bash
# List files in a directory
$NC files list --path /Documents

# Upload a file
$NC files upload --local ./report.pdf --remote /Documents/report.pdf

# Download a file
$NC files download --remote /Documents/report.pdf --local ./report.pdf

# Delete a file
$NC files delete --path /Documents/old.txt
```

### Notes (requires Nextcloud Notes app)

```bash
# List all notes
$NC notes list

# Create a note
$NC notes create --title "Meeting notes" --content "Discussed the Q3 roadmap."

# Edit a note
$NC notes edit --id 941 --title "Updated title" --content "New content here."

# Delete a note
$NC notes delete --id 941
```

### Calendar

```bash
# List calendars
$NC calendar list

# List events in a calendar
$NC calendar list --calendar "Personal"

# Create an event
$NC calendar create \
    --summary "Team standup" \
    --start "2026-07-01T09:00:00Z" \
    --end "2026-07-01T09:30:00Z" \
    --calendar "Work"

# Edit an event
$NC calendar edit --uid <event-uid> --summary "New title"

# Delete an event
$NC calendar delete --uid <event-uid>
```

### Tasks

```bash
# List all tasks
$NC tasks list

# Create a task
$NC tasks create --summary "Review pull request" --due "2026-07-05"

# Complete a task
$NC tasks complete --uid <task-uid>

# Edit a task
$NC tasks edit --uid <task-uid> --summary "Updated summary"
```

### Contacts

```bash
# List address books
$NC contacts list

# List contacts in an address book
$NC contacts list --addressbook "Personal"

# Get a contact by UID
$NC contacts get --uid <contact-uid>

# Export a contact as vCard
$NC contacts export --uid <contact-uid> --local ./contact.vcf
```

### Verify the setup

```bash
$NC check
```

The `SKILL.md` file is the skill manifest. Hermes Agent loads it automatically when the skill is installed.

## Security

Credentials are stored in `~/.hermes/nextcloud.env` with restricted file permissions (mode 0600). This file is never committed to git or shared anywhere.

The script only accepts an **App Password**, not your main Nextcloud password. App passwords can be revoked individually from Nextcloud Settings without affecting your main login.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b fix/something`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run a functional test against your own Nextcloud instance
5. Open a pull request
